A small mod that allows for the simple calculation of the instability of a Thaumcraft 4 infusion altar.

# How to use:

Install [Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), then [Thaumcraft](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2011841-), then this mod.
The research for the symmetry calculator is hidden with a Runic Matrix as the trigger - i.e. scan a runic matrix (after having researched Infusion) to get a clue for the symmetry calculator research.
